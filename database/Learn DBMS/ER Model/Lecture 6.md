#### Participation Constraints

Participation Constraints in an ER model define whether every entity in one group must be connected with at least one entity in another group or if the connection is optional.

**Total Participation:**
In a total participation constraint, each entity in a participation set must be associated with at least one entity in the related entity set.

**Partial Participation:**
In a partial participation constraint, entities in the participation set must be associated with at least one entity in the related entity set.
