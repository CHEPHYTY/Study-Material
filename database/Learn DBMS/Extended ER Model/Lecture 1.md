#### Extended ER features

**Why do we need?**

We design ER model for relationship between entities. In real-world the data may exhibit some hierarchical relationships, and the EER model provides mechanisms to represent these relationships accurately which helps in code reusability, ensuring data integrity and consistency and lower the complexity.

Extended ER features are
- Specialization (Top down Approach)
- Aggregation ()
- Generalization
