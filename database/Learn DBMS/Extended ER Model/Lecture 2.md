#### Specialization:

Specialization in the ER model is like categorizing entities based on common features.

A "Supertype" groups entities with shared attributes and relationships, while "Subtypes" have their own unique attribute and relationships. It's a way to organize data efficiently.

It is a Top-Down Approach.

We have "_is-a_" relationship between superclass an subclass.
