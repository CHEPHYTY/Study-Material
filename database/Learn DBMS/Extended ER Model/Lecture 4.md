#### Aggregation  :
Aggregation is like stacking things on top of each other to create a structure. 
It is used to create a hierarchical structure in data modeling, showing how a higher level entity is composed of lower-level entities.

Abstraction is employed to view relationships from a more general perspective focusing on a higher-level entity.
