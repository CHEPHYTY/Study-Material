#### Generalization:
Generalization is like finding things that are alike and putting them into a big group to represent what they have in common. It helps make things simpler and organized.

It is a Bottom-Up approach

We have "_is-a_" relationship between subclass and superclass.

There is another feature in Extended ER -
it called inheritance.

**Inheritance**
it is of 2 type.
- **Attribute inheritance:** Both specialization and generalization exhibit attribute inheritance.
- **Participation inheritance:** In this inheritance it states that if the parent exhibit any participation the child should exhibit such relation.
